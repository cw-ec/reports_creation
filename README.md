# Reports Creation

Suite of report creation tools created using python and leveraging additional libraries such as pandas and reportlab.
Reports are generated by Federal Electoral District (FED) and describe various aspects of the given FED. 

The following reports can be created using this tool:

|         Report Name         | Abbreviation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Requirements

This project will require the installation python 3.9 or newer. Package requirements can be found in the requirements.txt
and can be installed using pip or the package manager of your choice. 

Python will need to be called from the command line to test this open a command prompt window and type the command: python
into the box. If the command is not recognized add the folder containing your python.exe file to the path environment variable for your account.
If the python command opens the Windows store type the following into the search bar: "Manage app execution aliases" and turn of the two python
app installers that listed.

The required additional packages for this tool:

    - Pandas
    - Reportlab

Install required packages using the provided requirements.txt using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Should pip need to be updated navigate to the folder containing your python.exe and use the following command to update pip

    python.exe pip install --upgrade pip

## Usage 

In order to run the reports generation tool you will need to create a workflow. Example workflows can be found in the 
workflows directory at the root of this repository. Each workflow is a JSON file and contains the specific information
needed to direct the script in the creation of the desired reports.

The JSON should be formatted as follows:

    {
        "Report Abbreviation": [Array of FED Numbers, etc, etc]
    }

Using the above format a valid workflow would look as follows:

    {
        "PDP": [47001,48001, 24001],
        "PDD": [24005]
    }

The above script would create a PDP report for each of the three FED's listed in the array and a PDD report for the single
FED listed in its associated array. Only the report types being generated need an array unneeded report types can be removed 
from the workflow.
